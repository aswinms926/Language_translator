# Language Translation and Speech Recognition 

This application allows users to translate spoken text from one language to another. It uses the `deep_translator` library for translation, `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text conversion, and `gtts` for text-to-speech conversion. It also includes an audio playback feature using `pygame`.

## Features:
- Translate spoken text from one language to another.
- Supports multiple languages for both input and output.
- Audio feedback for user interactions using `pyttsx3` and `gtts`.
- Real-time translation with speech recognition.
